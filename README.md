# Emotion_Recognition
A basic implementation of attention detection using emotion recognition.

## 🔍Problem Definition
In the context of student learning, maintaining attention during study sessions is crucial for effective memorization and understanding. However, it can be challenging for students to remain focused during long recitation tasks. To address this issue, this project introduces a module for detecting attention variations in students while they recite, as part of a larger "Pupil AI Recitation Assistant".

## 🚀 Objective
This project aims to provide a practical solution 🛠️ for monitoring and improving students' attention during recitation. It incorporates:
- 🙁Emotion Recognition Model: Utilizes a machine learning model to recognize emotions and detect attention levels based on facial expressions in real-time.
- 📱Streamlit-based Interface: Offers a user-friendly front-end interface that includes:
    - 📸Screenshots of moments when attention lapses are detected.
    - ✔️Statistical analysis of attention focus percentages over the session.
- 📈Attention Improvement Suggestions: Integrates Alibaba’s Tongyi Qianwen API to provide personalized suggestions for improving attention based on detected patterns.

By combining these functionalities, this project not only tracks attention but also offers actionable insights to enhance focus during learning activities.

## ⏳Quick Start
To launch the project:
1. Open a terminal🔌.
2. Navigate to the project directory🔼.
3. Run the command: `streamlit run main.py`  

Then the web interface will be opened in your browser🌐.
